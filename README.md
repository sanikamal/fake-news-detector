# Fake News Detector
![Fake News](image/fakenews.png)

## Overview
Over the recent years, the growth of online social media has greatly facilitated the way people communicate with each other. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable. Our project aims to use Natural Language Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles.


## Problem Definition
Develop a machine learning program to identify when an article might be fake news. We aim to use a corpus of labeled real and fake news articles to build a classifier that can make decisions about information based on the content from the corpus. The model will focus on identifying fake news.

## Dataset Description

**train.csv:** A full training dataset with the following attributes:
        id: unique id for a news article
        title: the title of a news article
        author: author of the news article
        text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
        label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable
            1: unreliable
            0: reliable

**test.csv:** A testing training dataset with all the same attributes at train.csv without the label.
